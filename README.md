   - Queries used to explore the dataset and calculate metrics like:
     - Total sales, total transactions, and average transaction value.
     - Sales by region, product, and month.
     - Top-selling products and customer demographics.
     - Promotional vs non-promotional sales breakdown.

2. **Insights Document** (`key_insights.md`):
