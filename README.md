# Incubyte Data Craftsperson Assignment

This repository contains the SQL scripts and key insights derived from analyzing the sales dataset provided as part of the assessment for the Data Craftsperson role at Incubyte.

---

## **Objective**
The goal of this analysis was to explore the dataset and extract key insights, focusing on both aggregate metrics and detailed drill-downs of the sales data.

---

## **Contents**
1. **SQL Scripts** (`sales_analysis.sql`):
   - Queries used to explore the dataset and calculate metrics like:
     - Total sales, total transactions, and average transaction value.
     - Sales by region, product, and month.
     - Top-selling products and customer demographics.
     - Promotional vs non-promotional sales breakdown.

2. **Insights Document** (`key_insights.md`):
   - Summarized findings from the analysis, including:
     - Aggregate metrics (e.g., total sales).
     - Drill-down insights (e.g., sales by region, product trends, and payment methods).

---

## **Key Highlights**
- Total sales: ₹10.20 Cr across 3.75 Lakh transactions, with an average transaction value of ₹20.41 K.
- Top-selling products: Laptop (₹6.23 Cr), Sofa (₹3.78 Cr), T-Shirt (₹1.02 Cr).
- Sales by region: South leads with ₹3.18 Cr, followed by East (₹2.65 Cr).
- Monthly trends: January 2022 had the highest sales (₹6.72 Cr), with a sharp decline in February (₹3.20 Lakh).

| **Task**                        | **Time Allocated** | **Description**                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GitHub Repository Setup**     | 5 minutes         | - Created a new repository.<br>- Added necessary files like `README.md`.<br>- Structured folders for SQL scripts and documentation. |
| **Organizing and Documenting SQL** | 40 minutes         | - Wrote and commented SQL queries for clarity.<br>- Organized queries into sections (cleaning, standardization, analysis).<br>- Verified SQL syntax and logic. |
| **Commit and Push to GitHub**    | 10 minutes         | - Added files (SQL scripts, insights, `README.md`).<br>- Wrote descriptive commit messages.<br>- Pushed changes to remote repository. |
| **Final Review and Validation**  | 5 minutes         | - Reviewed `README.md` for clarity.<br>- Cross-checked SQL scripts for accuracy.<br>- Verified repository structure and formatting. |

**Total Time**: **1 Hour**

By following this structured approach, the project was delivered efficiently within the time constraint while maintaining high quality.


## **How to Use**
1. **Explore SQL Scripts**:
- Use the `sales_analysis.sql` file to replicate the queries in a SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- Ensure the dataset is loaded into a database before running the queries.

2. **View Key Insights**:
   - Open the `key_insights.md` file for a summary of findings.

---

## **Tools Used**
- **SQL**: For data exploration and analysis.
- **GitHub**: To host and share the code and insights.
- **Dataset Provided**: The dataset used for this analysis was provided by Incubyte as part of the assessment. Due to confidentiality, the dataset is not included in this repository.
